# User Management Module for Puppet EdgeOps

This module provides example NETCONF tasks for managing user accounts on Arista cEOS devices. It is designed to be used with the Puppet EdgeOps Module, enabling automated user management through standardized workflows.

ðŸ¤– **AI-Assisted:** These examples were generated using Puppet Edge and the Puppet Edge MCP server.

## Purpose

The User Management module examples help network administrators automate the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts on supported network devices. By leveraging NETCONF, these tasks ensure consistent and reliable configuration management.

## Tasks Overview

The `tasks` subfolder contains individual NETCONF task examples, each demonstrating a specific user management action, such as:

- Creating a new user account
- Deleting existing user accounts

Each task is self-contained and can be used as a reference or integrated into your own automation workflows.

## Usage

1. Review the tasks in the `tasks` subfolder to find the action you need.
2. Customize the task parameters as required for your environment.
3. Execute the tasks using Puppet EdgeOps to manage users on your network devices.

## Requirements

- Puppet EdgeOps Module
- Network devices supporting NETCONF and OpenConfig models
